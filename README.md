# Biztime

A toy Express.js API for recording data about companies' industries and invoices.

## Implementation

Written with TypeScript, Express.js, using a Postgres database, tested with Jest and Supertest.

This uses a traditional imperative style and throws errors on invalid data instead of the much more functional approach in https://github.com/Lactantius/express-cart.

## TODO

- [ ] More consistent useage of type annotations
- [ ] Generally clean up code and split out more into separate functions
- [ ] Test for actual changes to the database, not just correct responses
- [ ] Test more for errors
- [ ] Add more custom error responses
- [ ] Lots more features...
